# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

In my Getting_and_Cleaning_Data_Course_Project repo there are these elements:

1. *Samsung_Data"* directory: it contains all the data to be used for the analysis
2. *code_book.md*: file that explains the features of *DATA_SET.txt*
2. *DATA_SET.txt*: it is the file generated by the *run_analysis.R*
3. *README.md*: it is the current market down explanation file
4. *run_analysis.R*: it is the R script that generates the *DATA_SET.txt*

Below I explain the structure of *run_analysis.R.* 

First of all, to run the code, I recommend to set my Github repo as the Files Pane Location of R Studio and to click "Set Working Directory --> To Files Pane Location" from Session Tab in RStudio. The subtitles here below are linked to each of the five steps requested for this project: the R script sections follows these five steps. 

I underline that at the top of R script there is the loading of dplyr  

## STEP 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
